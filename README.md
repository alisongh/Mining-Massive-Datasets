## What is the course about?
In this course, you will learn many of the interesting algorithms that have been developed for efficient processing of large amounts of data in order to extract simple and useful models of that data. These techniques are often used to predict properties of future instances of the same sort of data, or simply to make sense of the data already available. Many people view data mining, or "big data" as machine learning. There are indeed some techniques for processing large datasets that can be considered machine learning, and we shall cover a number of these. But there are also many algorithms and ideas for dealing with big data that are not usually classified as machine learning, and we shall cover many of these as well.
